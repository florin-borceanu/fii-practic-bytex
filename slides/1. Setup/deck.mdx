## Components 🧱

---

Components are the main building block for Angular applications.

---

## Modules 🧶

---

Modules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. They can contain components, service providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing module.

---

## Router 🗺

---

In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page.
